# Iris Flower Classification

![Iris Flowers](https://example.com/iris_flower_image.png)

Welcome to the Iris Flower Classification repository! This project focuses on classifying Iris flowers into different species based on various features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. It serves as a simple yet classic example of a machine learning classification problem.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used for this project is the famous Iris dataset, which is commonly used for learning and practicing machine learning techniques. It contains 150 samples of Iris flowers, each with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a target variable indicating the species of the flower.

- **Data Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)

## Project Structure

- `iris_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference.
- `iris.csv`: Dataset file containing the features and target variable.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the notebook.

## Analysis Highlights

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, distributions, and relationships between features.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values (if any), and prepare it for model training.
- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify Iris flowers.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Inference**: Make predictions on new data to classify Iris flowers into species.

## How to Use

To run the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/sansutiwary/IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION.git`
